# The Above Theme

My personal blue-accented themes for IntelliJ IDEs.

Editor theme is based off of [Rider UI Theme Pack](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13883-rider-ui-theme-pack)'s "Rider Melon Dark/Light" with some minor changes.

## The Above Dark "A Night of Peace"

## The Above Light "Sky of Snow"
